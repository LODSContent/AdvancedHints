# How to Open the Terminal in Linux
- To open the Linux command line (CLI) on your machine, you can use any of the following options:
<br><br>
## Open the Terminal From the Applications Menu
- Since you want to launch your favorite terminal with a few clicks, you can directly open it from the menu option at the bottom of your screen. Go to your Linux applications menu, navigate to the terminal icon, and click to launch it.
<br>
<br>
- Alternatively, you can press Super (the Windows key) to open the application launcher on your desktop. These steps are more or less standard for all famous Linux desktop environments.
<br><br>
## Use Keyboard Shortcuts to Open the Linux Terminal
- An alternate way to open the terminal window is to use keyboard shortcuts. If you are a fan of keyboard shortcuts, you can press the Ctrl + Alt + T key to fire up the terminal.
<br>
<br>
- The best part about Linux is that there are many shortcuts you can use on your Linux desktop. From tweaking application shortcuts to managing and using handy keyboard shortcuts for Bash, you name it, and you have it.
<br><br>
## Using the "Run a Command" Window
- Another way to open a terminal is by pressing Alt + F2. In the Run a Command dialog box, enter gnome-terminal. The terminal command will work only on a GNOME desktop. Depending on the terminal you're using, there will be similar commands for other desktop environments.

- You can trigger the Alt + F2 keyboard shortcut on KDE-enabled distros to open the native KRunner. Then, type in "konsole," KDE's terminal window, to open the terminal.

## Set a Custom Keyboard Shortcut for the Terminal
- There might be a situation wherein you need a pre-existing shortcut to open the terminal directly. But what if you want to avoid opening it via the default Ctrl + Alt + T shortcut? While the steps are somewhat similar for most Linux desktops, they might vary a bit on a few desktops.
<br><br>
- In such a case, you can set a different keyboard shortcut by following the below steps:
<br><br>
 - Press the Alt + F2 keys to open the Run a Command window. In the search field, type in the term "keyboard." This will bring up the keyboard settings.
 - Click the + sign or the View and Customize Shortcuts option on the GNOME desktop. Alternatively, you can edit the keyboard shortcuts on Xfce by navigating to the Application Shortcuts tab and editing the Terminal Emulator shortcut.
 - Follow the on-screen instructions to edit the desired shortcut.
<br><br>
## Create a Taskbar Shortcut for the Terminal
- On GNOME, you can create a terminal shortcut on your taskbar, by dragging the terminal icon from the main menu, onto your desktop's taskbar. Every time you click the icon, you can launch the terminal within seconds.
